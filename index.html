                Happy Valentines Day, Nick!<br><br>
                I really hope you like this wee lil thing i made for you! I had to somewhat learn 3 different coding languages and ill admit i used a bit of ai...i'm sorry I SWEAR I WILL DO ANOTHER FULLY ON MY OWN JUST YOU WAIT! anyways...I really hope you know how much you mean to me dear, this is the best way i can express how much i care and love you with our distance. I wanted to do something that requires time and effort to show my appreciation and affection towards you. I'm so damn happy that i get to spend this lovely day with the best person in the whole damn world, and i'm also happy that you are my first valentines that has actually made me feel happy instead of sad on valentines day. You make me the happiest person that one can possibly be, i think im honestly getting smile lines from how much i smile when i think about you, text you, see you or hear you. I cannot begin to describe how i feel inside my missing heart (you stole it you mf). When I get a text from you or the cutest snap of you, my heart races. When you’re all sweet, calling me names n whatnot my heart flutters. When we call and we’re both admiring each other it warms my heart. I’m so grateful for the last 2-3 months we’ve been together, it’s been the best few months ever and i can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives together. I love you so so so much baby.
